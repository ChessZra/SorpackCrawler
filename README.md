# SorpackCrawler
SorpackCrawler is a scraper tool. It is a Python program that extracts data from the market website sorpack.com and finds the best deals available in the market. It utilizes the scrapy library, a powerful web scraping framework, to crawl through the website and collect relevant data.

Feel free to use SorpackCrawler for your own convenience as well. It is available on GitHub for anyone who wants to take advantage of its features.
Any changes in the extracted website would require code maintenance. Just make a few changes in the code to get it working if it's not.

# Features
* Automatic data extraction: SorpackCrawler automatically navigates through the sorpack.com website, visiting different pages, and extracting information about products and their prices.
* Deal analysis: The program analyzes the extracted data to identify the best deals available in the market.
